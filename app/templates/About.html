  <h1>Fraud Detection on Bank Payments</h1>
  <section>
      <h2>Fraud and Detecting It</h2>
      <p>Fraudulent behavior can be seen across many different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, payment and banking systems. Fraud is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. The PwC global economic crime survey of 2018 [1] found that half (49 percent) of the 7,200 companies they surveyed had experienced fraud of some kind.</p>
      <p>Even if fraud seems to be scary for businesses it can be detected using intelligent systems such as rules engines or machine learning. Most people here in Kaggle are familiar with machine learning but for rule engines here is a quick information. A rules engine is a software system that executes one or more business rules in a runtime production environment. These rules are generally written by domain experts for transferring the knowledge of the problem to the rules engine and from there to production. Two rules examples for fraud detection would be limiting the number of transactions in a time period (velocity rules), denying the transactions which come from previously known fraudulent IP's and/or domains.</p>
      <p>Rules are great for detecting some types of fraud but they can fire a lot of false positives or false negatives in some cases because they have predefined threshold values. For example, let's think of a rule for denying a transaction which has an amount that is bigger than 10000 dollars for a specific user. If this user is an experienced fraudster, he/she may be aware of the fact that the system would have a threshold and he/she can just make a transaction just below the threshold value (9999 dollars).</p>
      <p>For these types of problems, ML comes for help and reduces the risk of frauds and the risk of business to lose money. With the combination of rules and machine learning, detection of the fraud would be more precise and confident.</p>

      <h2>Banksim Dataset</h2>
      <p>We detect the fraudulent transactions from the Banksim dataset. This synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts. For more information on the dataset, you can check the Kaggle page for this dataset which also has the link to the original paper.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>Step:</strong> This feature represents the day from the start of simulation. It has 180 steps so the simulation ran for virtually 6 months.</li>

  <p>Let's look at column types and missing values in data. Oh, I'm sorry there are no missing values which means we don't have to perform an imputation.</p>
  
  <pre>
  data.info()
  &lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;
  RangeIndex: 594643 entries, 0 to 594642
  Data columns (total 10 columns):
  step           594643 non-null int64
  customer       594643 non-null object
  age            594643 non-null object
  gender         594643 non-null object
  zipcodeOri     594643 non-null object

  fraud          594643 non-null int64
  dtypes: float64(1), int64(2), object(7)
  memory usage: 45.4+ MB
  </pre>
  
  <p>Fraud data will be imbalanced like you see in the plot below and from the count of instances. To balance the data and reduce bias we'll oversample the minority class later on.</p>
  
  <pre>
  data.fraud.value_counts()
  0    587443
  1      7200
  Name: fraud, dtype: int64
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>As we can see, some of the columns are categorical and should be converted to numeric values. We'll apply one hot encoding for that.</p>
  
  <h3>Label Encoding</h3>
  <pre>
  # Define function to apply label encoding to necessary columns
  def label_encode(df, columns):
      for col in columns:
          le = LabelEncoder()
          df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])
      return df
  
  # Columns to apply label encoding
  columns_to_encode = ['customer', 'zipMerchant', 'merchant', 'category', 'zipcodeOri']
  
  # Apply label encoding
  data = label_encode(data, columns_to_encode)
  </pre>
  
  <h3>One Hot Encoding</h3>
  <pre>
  # Apply one hot encoding to the gender column
  data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['gender'])
  </pre>
  
  <p>Now, let's create the features and labels.</p>
  
  <pre>
  # Create features and labels
  X = data.drop('fraud', axis=1)
  y = data['fraud']
  </pre>
  
  <h3>Train Test Split</h3>
  <pre>
  # Split the data into training and test sets
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  </pre>
  
  <h3>Oversampling with SMOTE</h3>
  <pre>
  # Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset
  smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
  X_train_res, y_train_res = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Models</h2>
  <p>We will use K-Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier to predict the fraud. Let's start with K-Neighbors Classifier.</p>
  
  <h3>K-Neighbors Classifier</h3>
  <pre>
  # Initialize and train K-Neighbors Classifier
  knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
  knn.fit(X_train_res, y_train_res)
  
  # Predict on test data
  y_pred_knn = knn.predict(X_test)
  
  # Print classification report
  print('K-Neighbors Classifier')
  print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_knn))
  </pre>
  
  <h3>Random Forest Classifier</h3>
  <pre>
  # Initialize and train Random Forest Classifier
  rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
  rf.fit(X_train_res, y_train_res)
  
  # Predict on test data
  y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test)
  
  # Print classification report
  print('Random Forest Classifier')
  print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf))
  </pre>
  
  <h3>XGBoost Classifier</h3>
  <pre>
  # Initialize and train XGBoost Classifier
  xgb = XGBClassifier(random_state=42)
  xgb.fit(X_train_res, y_train_res)
  
  # Predict on test data
  y_pred_xgb = xgb.predict(X_test)
  
  # Print classification report
  print('XGBoost Classifier')
  print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_xgb))
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In this notebook, we have gone through the process of fraud detection using machine learning models on the Banksim dataset. We performed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and applied three different classifiers: K-Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost. We also balanced the dataset using SMOTE. Each model's performance was evaluated and printed using the classification report. From the results, we can determine the most effective model for detecting fraudulent transactions.</p>
